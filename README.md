# Baltimore City Food Insecurity Exploration

## Background
Food insecurity is a concerning issue in many urban environments, including Baltimore City. It increases residents’ risk of chronic illness and causes extreme stress and burden. Black and low-income Americans are disproportionately affected by food insecurity. Fundamentally, not addressing this problem will lead to continually worse health outcomes in Baltimore’s most vulnerable residents and worsen racial disparities by inhibiting the access of communities of color to basic necessities.  This project uses neighborhood-level Baltimore data to analyze what factors contribute to food insecurity and how these factors relate to health outcomes. This project also analyzes how these trends may differ across neighborhoods in Baltimore. This detailed analysis will allow policymakers to take targeted, nuanced approaches to food insecurity in the city and avoid the possibility of drawing blanket conclusions that will not serve the most vulnerable populations. Policymakers should use the analysis provided to optimize resource allocation to neighborhoods that are at greatest risk for poor health outcomes due to food insecurity.
